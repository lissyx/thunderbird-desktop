"""Schedule the Thunderbird Enterprise shippable builds and repacks at most
once a day per branch.

TODO: Remove this module once Thunderbird Enterprise schedules its repacks
through the release promotion action, as Firefox Enterprise does.

Until then, nothing asks for the repacks: every level 3 push schedules the
shippable builds, the repacks made from them and their OCI uploads, which is
costly and races between pushes. The first push of each UTC day on a branch
schedules them, and marks it in the index at
`SHIPPABLE_REPACKS_PRODUCED_INDEX`. Later pushes on that day find the entry and
skip them.

The entry is inserted as soon as the decision task chooses to schedule them,
long before they are created, let alone completed: despite its name, it means
"scheduled". This leaves only a short window for two decision tasks to both
schedule them, as the index offers no atomic way to claim an entry.

The entry points to the decision task that inserted it, and is ignored when that
task failed, so the next push schedules them again. To schedule them again
anyway, e.g. to ship a fix the same day, delete the entry with
`index.deleteTask`, which requires the
`index:delete-task:<index path>` scope, then push or rerun the decision task.
